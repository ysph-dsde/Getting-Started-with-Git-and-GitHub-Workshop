# Getting Started with Git and GitHub

## About The Coffee, Cookie and Coding $\left(C^3\right)$ Workshops

Yale's Public Health Data Science and Data Equity (DSDE) team created this workshop series for Public Health and Biostatistics masters-level students at Yale. They are designed to help learners effectively leverage computational tools and analytical methods in their educational and professional endeavors. You can find out more about past and upcoming tutorials on our YouTube (coming soon) and [website](https://ysph.yale.edu/public-health-research-and-practice/research-centers-and-initiatives/public-health-data-science-and-data-equity/events/).

## About Repository

This repository stands as the unifying GitHub page for the Getting Started with Git and GitHub workshop. In it, you will only find the the full slide deck that was used during the workshop. There are two additional GitHub repsitories associated with this workshop that include the worked through example code: [JHU-CRC-Cases-and-Recoveries](https://github.com/ysph-dsde/JHU-CRC-Cases-and-Recoveries) and [JHU-CRC-Vaccinations](https://github.com/ysph-dsde/JHU-CRC-Vaccinations).

## About Original Data Source

The [Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/) (JHU CRC) tracked and compiled global COVID-19 pandemic data from January 22, 2020 and March 10, 2023. These data are publically available through their two GitHub repositories. We imported cumulative vaccination counts for the U.S. from their [GovEX/COVID-19](https://github.com/govex/COVID-19/tree/master/data_tables/vaccine_data) GitHub repository. The raw data used in the analysis script can be found in the data_tables/vaccine_data/us_data/time_series subdirectory ([original source](https://github.com/govex/COVID-19/blob/master/data_tables/vaccine_data/us_data/time_series/time_series_covid19_vaccine_us.csv)).

The data dictionary provided by JHU CRC has been copied to this repository ([original source](https://github.com/govex/COVID-19/tree/master/data_tables/vaccine_data/us_data)). Additional details and methods for harmonizing the U.S. Census Bureau's 2010 to 2019 population projections with 2020 to 2023 vintages can be found in the "Population Estimates and Projections" subdirectory of this GitHub repository.
